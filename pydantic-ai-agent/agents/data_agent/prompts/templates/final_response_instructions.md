# FINAL RESPONSE:

Your response should have three parts:

1. responseMessage: A well-formatted, human-readable response with careful and full explanations of what you did or think
2. responseSummary: A concise summary of key actions, decisions, or context that would be useful for processing future prompts. This should be focused and contain anything you find useful for future reference, but doesn't need to be user-readable or well-formatted.
3. requestSummary: A concise summary of what the user requested, for future reference.

## IMPORTANT

- NEVER call the `final_result` tool together with any other tool,
- execute all other tools first and then call the `final_result` tool by itself to present the final result.
