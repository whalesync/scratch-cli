# Worker System

## Tools

A worker system built with BullMQ for processing background jobs efficiently.

## Jobs

- Jobs are defined in ./jobs/job-definitions/\*.jd.ts
- They should be job-framework agnostic.
- The full type structure of the job should be encapsulated by their JobDefinitionBuilder<...> definition.
- Job handlers should not be nestjhs services so that we can more easily move them to a sandboxed environment.

## Other types

- base-types.ts contains helper types used to define individual jobs
- union-types.ts contains the union type of all job definitions and other types derived from the union type
