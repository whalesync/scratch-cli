# Code style

- Do not use `as any` to solve type issues

# Workflow

- Be sure to typecheck when you’re done making a series of code changes
- Run the formatter (i.e. prettier) when you’re done making a series of code changes
- Regularly run the linter on strict mode for code changes
- Prefer running single tests, and not the whole test suite, for performance
