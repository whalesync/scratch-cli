# Server development
The source under /server is the backend for this project.

## Technologies
- Always use yarn.
- It is a NestJS project that serves REST.
- The application database is Postgres, managed by prisma. The schema is defined at server/prisma/schema.prisma. 
- If schema.prisma is edited, you must run `yarn prisma generate` to generate the new types. 
- DO NOT GENERATE A PRISMA MIGRATION. The user will generate those manually after verifying the schema changes. They are hard to undo. `yarn prisma generate` is always safe to run, though.
